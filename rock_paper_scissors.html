<h1>Rock Paper Scissors</h1>
<p style="font-size:110%;">Test your knowledge of if-else statements by completing this game.<br>When you see input.lower() that
means that Python is converting the user-input to lowercase letters. That way, if someone typed "ROCK" or "Rock", then the
program does not have to check for all those scenarios, it simply needs to convert it to lowercase, then check to see
if input == "rock".</p>

<p>
  Can you fill in the blank options for if you chose scissors (WIN, LOSE, and TIE)? Fill it in and then test your game.
  <br><b>Bonus: </b> Add another option to the regular Rock Paper Scissors (like 'Instant Win'), then be sure to add 
  another elif statement to check for this option and fill in all the possible outcomes for your new game.
