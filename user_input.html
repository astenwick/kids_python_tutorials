<h1>User Input</h1>
<p style="font-size:110%;">Sometimes we want to use variables to store things that the user types in. <br>
For this, we can use a function called input(). We can tell input() what to ask the user, then store their answer in a variable:
<p>animal = input("What is your favorite animal?")</p>
