<h1>If-Else</h1>
<p style="font-size:110%;">
You can use Python to determine if a statement is True or False.<br>
Normal symbols like <, <=, >, >=  all work just like they do in Math. To test for an equality, use double-equals:<br>
age==10, this is becaue age=10 will simply set the age variable to 10.<br>
To test for inequality, use !=:
age!=10<br>
Now that we know how to test a statement for True or False, we can use that with if-else statements to decide when to run
certain commands. If our statement is true, then we will run the commands immediately following it that are indented.<br>
If something is not true, we will skip and run the statement.
