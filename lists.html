<h1>Lists</h1>
<p style="font-size:100%";>Lists are used to store a collection of like values. A list could be anything from a collection of names to a list
of phone numbers.
<p>In this next example we will use Lists along with a Python library called random. We can use this to pick a random choice 
from one of our lists.</p>

<p style="font-size:110%";>Can you add some more choices to the list? Can you finish the last line and have it print a 
random choice from our list of numbers?<br><a href="http://astenwick.github.io/kids_python_tutorials/">Go Back</a>
