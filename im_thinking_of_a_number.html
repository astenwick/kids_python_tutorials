<h1>I'm thinking of a number game</h1>
<p style="font-size:100%;">This game take user-input and tests it against a number that the computer randomly chose.<br>Try to find the two while-statements and see what it happening. One is to keep the game going until the user decides to quit. The other is to allow the user to keep guessing. While statements are a type of loop in Python and keep going until the the statement is no longer true.
