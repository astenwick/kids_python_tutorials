<h1>Variables</h1>
<p style="font-size:110%;">In programming, variables are used to hold values. These values are saved until you change them.<br><br>
city = "Bremerton"
<br>In this example, city is the variable name, and "Bremerton" is the value.<br><br>
year = 2016
<br>In this example, year is the variable name, and 2016 is the value. Here, 2016 is a number, not a String.
You can use variables in everything that you've already learned, in both printing text and doing Math operations.</p>
