<h1>Strings</h1>
<p style="font-size:125%;">Text, or words in computer science are called Strings. You can create a String by simply surrounding your text with quotes, 
either double-quotes ("") or single-quotes(''), just make sure to stick with one type per String. You can even add Strings
together by using the addition sign but be sure to add your own spaces between your words because String addition does
not do this automatically.
