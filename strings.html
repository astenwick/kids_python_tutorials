<h1>Strings</h1>
<p style="font-size:110%;">Text, or words in computer science are called Strings.<br><br> You can create a String by simply surrounding your text with quotes, 
either double-quotes (" ") or single-quotes(' '), just make sure to stick with one type. <br><br>You can even add Strings
together by using the addition sign<br>"Happy " + "Birthday" <br>but be sure to add your own spaces between your words because String addition does
not do this automatically.<br>
